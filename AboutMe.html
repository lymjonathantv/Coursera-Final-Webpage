<h3>About me.</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan Lee, and I am a student in the 'Software Engineering - Game Programming' program at Centennial College.<br>I am so happy to share some interesting stuff about me. Especially this is my first time studying the Software Engineering program, I am excited to present information about me through this website I created.</p>

<p>I was born in Hong Kong in 1998 (I am 22 years old). I was the only child in the family so I was blessed. I attended Lingnan Primary School when I was 6; Since then, I knew how to speak Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. My favourite subject was Physical Education "P.E", ironically I was not into sports back then. </p>
<p>When I attended junior High at Creative Secondary School in Hong Kong, I started to discover myself a lot more. I started to play soccer as my main sport, and I played badminton occasionally. I started to learn hip hop dance at the age of 14. And I joined the Chinese Drama Team in grade 9. Needless to say, these activities played a crucial role in my confidence build-up.</p>
<p>However, I hit a huge wall in grade 11 when I had a combination of family businesses and illness that caused me to fail in high school. Not giving up, I had deciced to change schools to Delia School of Canada, where I studied under the OSSD for 2 years, and finally got my high school diploma.</p>
<p>I came to Canada in Fall 2017, and studied the Occupational Therapist Assistant & Physiotherapy Assistant program at Centennial College. It wasn't easy at all. So by the end of the second year, I'd decided to change my program. Abandoning my program diploma, I came to study this Game Programming program in Fall 2019.</p>
<p>Personally, I do not care if I had a bad reputaion of always falling right before the finish line, but what I care most is the things I picked up during the race. And now I'm here, anticipating the new start of my next race.</p>
